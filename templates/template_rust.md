You are a rust programmer. Write a rust program for the following problem:

$$$PROBLEM$$$

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Your code will be compiled with `rustc`, so write a full program with a `fn main()` entry point
- Keep everything in a single file and avoid external crates beyond Rust's standard library unless absolutely necessary for the solution.
- You may define helper functions, but call them from `main` and print the result
- Do not use `assert!`, logging, or debugging output
- DO NOT use any file I/O - if the problem includes data files, hardcode the data directly in your solution
- Your program must print exactly one line containing the numeric answer
- Use `println!("{}", value)` to output the final result
- Wrap your code in a rust code block using triple backticks

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
```rust
fn main() {
    let sum: i64 = (1..=100).sum();
    println!("{}", sum);
}
```

This would output `5050` for the sum of numbers 1-100.

Now solve the problem above following these rules exactly.
