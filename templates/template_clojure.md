You are a clojure programmer. Write a clojure program for the following problem:

$$$PROBLEM$$$

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Your code will be executed with `clj -M -e "<your-code>"`, so write a simple inline script that prints the answer
- DO NOT use `(ns ...)` namespace declarations
- DO NOT use `-main` functions - write inline code instead
- You may define helper functions with `defn`, but make sure to call them and print the result
- DO NOT use any file I/O - if the problem includes data files, hardcode the data directly in your solution
- Your code must print exactly one value: the numeric answer to the problem
- Use `(println ...)` to output the final result
- Wrap your code in a clojure code block using triple backticks

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
```clojure
(println (reduce + (range 1 101)))
```

This would output `5050` for the sum of numbers 1-100.

Now solve the problem above following these rules exactly.
