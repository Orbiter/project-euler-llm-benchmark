You are a java programmer. Write a java program for the following problem:

$$$PROBLEM$$$

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Your code will be compiled with `javac` and run with `java`, so write a complete class with a `public static void main(String[] args)` entry point
- Declare a single `public` class (e.g., `Main`) and include all logic inside that class
- Avoid imports unless absolutely necessary; rely on core language features whenever possible
- Do not use `assert`, logging, or debugging output
- DO NOT use any file I/O - if the problem includes data files, hardcode the data directly in your solution
- Your program must print exactly one line containing the numeric answer
- Use `System.out.println(...)` to output the final result
- Wrap your code in a java code block using triple backticks

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

This would output `5050` for the sum of numbers 1-100.

Now solve the problem above following these rules exactly.
