You are a python programmer. Write a python program for the following problem:

$$$PROBLEM$$$

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Your code will be executed with `python3`, so write a standalone script that prints the answer
- Avoid unnecessary imports; only use modules when absolutely required for the solution
- You may define helper functions, but make sure to call them and print the result
- Do not use `assert` statements or debugging prints
- DO NOT use any file I/O - if the problem includes data files, hardcode the data directly in your solution
- Your program must print exactly one line containing the numeric answer
- Use `print(...)` to output the final result
- Wrap your code in a python code block using triple backticks

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
```python
print(sum(range(1, 101)))
```

This would output `5050` for the sum of numbers 1-100.

Now solve the problem above following these rules exactly.
